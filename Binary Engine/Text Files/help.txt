WORD CLOUD
            
Word clouds are a useful way to visualize text data because they make understanding word frequencies easier.

Words that appear more frequently within the text appear larger in the cloud. 

Stop words are words that are removed from the word cloud and will not be displayed in the cloud. Words like "the", "we" , "i", "and" etc, are usually added as stopwords.
